        Working with Rome Total War text files is a tedious and error-prone
        work. This RTW modding tool allows you to safely modify attack and
        defence values of Rome Total War units, without messing anything
        important in your game files. Code that runs behind the scene will
        create "export_descr_unit.txt" file based on changes you make and will
        download it on your computer as soon as you click "submit" button.
        <br />
        The file is fully ready to be used - just throw it into Data folder of
        your RTW game directory and replace your original file. If during the
        editing you want to take a break or just want to avoid losing values
        that you have typed so far - save your progress with "save current
        values" button, and when you come back - press "load saved data". It
        will load your latest save, and then you can continue modding.

      <p>
        Note #1 - units that have no secondary attack, don`t have missile
        weapons. This is why appropriate input is disabled.
        <br />
        Note #2 - units that DO have missile weapons use "primary attack" for
        ranged damage, and secondary attack for melee weapon damage.
        <br />
        Note #3 - for units that have crew - like siege machines, the primary
        attack defines damage of the crew, while secondary attack defines damage
        of the actual siege machine.
        <br />
        Note #4 - this tool was made for and was tested for Rome Total War
        original(!) game.
